# 🛍️ Learning Front-End React with E-Commerce Implementation

This is a personal learning project I built from scratch to practice and understand **React.js** as a front-end web developer.  
The main goal of this project is to **learn React concepts** by creating a simple **E-Commerce user interface**.

The project is still in progress and will continue to grow as I keep learning and improving my front-end development skills.  
For now, all **product and user data** are fetched using the public API from [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/).

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates a simple **E-Commerce web app** where users can view and explore products.  
It focuses on learning how to build a **React-based UI**, how to fetch and display data from an API, and how to organize components properly.

There is no backend yet — only the front-end part using React.  
The goal is to create a **functional and clean UI** that helps me understand React better.
